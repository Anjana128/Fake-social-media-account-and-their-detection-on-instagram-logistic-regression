#Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the Logistic Regression algorithm using Python. Logistic Regression is a widely used supervised learning algorithm for binary and multi-class classification tasks.

#Features
Implements Logistic Regression from scratch.
Supports binary and multi-class classification.
Includes data visualization and performance evaluation.


#Installation
To run the Logistic Regression algorithm, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Alternatively, if using Jupyter Notebook, ensure all required libraries are installed before running the notebook.

#Usage
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Navigate to the repository:
cd your-repo
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook logistic.ipynb
Run the cells sequentially to execute the Logistic Regression algorithm.

#Example
Load a dataset (e.g., Titanic dataset, Iris dataset, or any custom dataset).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train and evaluate the model.

#Results
The notebook includes performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.


#Contributing
Feel free to contribute by submitting issues or pull requests. If you improve the algorithm, fix bugs, or add new features, please update the documentation accordingly.
